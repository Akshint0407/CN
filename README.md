# CN-Lab 🚀

This repository contains Cisco Packet Tracer simulation files created as part of the **Computer Network Lab (CNL)** coursework.

## 🧠 About

The files in this repo are designed to help understand the fundamentals of computer networks using practical Cisco Packet Tracer simulations.  
All simulations were built during the lab sessions and cover key networking concepts like:

- Basic network topology setup  
- Router and switch configuration  
- IP addressing and subnetting  
- Static and dynamic routing  

> ⚠️ Note: This repo currently contains only Cisco Packet Tracer (`.pkt`) files.

## 🛠 Requirements
