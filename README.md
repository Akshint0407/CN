# CN-Lab 🚀

This repository contains Cisco Packet Tracer simulation files created as part of the **Computer Network Lab (CNL)** coursework.

## 🧠 About

The files in this repo are designed to help understand the fundamentals of Computer Networks.The focus is mainly on **Cisco Packet Tracer simulations** along with some **network programming in Python** (TCP, UDP, DNS, etc.).

> ⚠️ Note: This repo currently contains only Cisco Packet Tracer (`.pkt`) files.

## 🛠 Requirements

- [Cisco Packet Tracer](https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer) (Recommended version: 8.0 or above)


<h2>💻 Built with</h2>

Technologies used in the project:

*   Cisco Packet Tracer
*   Python

## 🛠️ Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository to your local machine:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Akshint0407/CN-Lab.git

2. Navigate to the folder and open the code you want to explore!

> ⚠️ Note: Each file is named based on the concept it demonstrates. Open the `.pkt` files in Cisco Packet Tracer to explore or modify the network.
